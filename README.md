# FittingDataInProbDistrCurve
This program plots graph of the input data (e.g. monthly discharge) with Normal distribution curve, LogNormal distribution curve,  Exponential curve, GEV curve. Also it finds K-S and critical value to compare them. You can import the K-S in excel, Save the PDF (Probability Density Function) and monthly CDF (Cumulative Distribution Function).
